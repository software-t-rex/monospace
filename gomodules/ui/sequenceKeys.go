// SequenceKeysMap is a map of sequence keys to their corresponding key names.
// This map is used to convert escape sequences to key names.
// here are some volountary ignored keys and the reason why:
// - ctrl+h: is detected as backspace
// - ctrl+i: is detected as tab
// - ctrl+j: is detected as enter
// - ctrl+m: is detected as enter
// - ctrl+v: is not detected and is an os paste on windows
// - ctrl+z: is not detected and trigger EOF on windows and may suspend on *nix
// - ctrl+h: is detected as backspace
// - f10 is unreachable on my computer and not tested
// - f11 is full screen on some terminals
// For other keys to be added you can propose a PR with the key.
// there's some tools to help you to get the key sequence in the tools directory
