## monospace tasks remove

Remove tasks defined in monospace.yml pipeline.

### Synopsis

Remove tasks defined in monospace.yml pipeline.
You can pass a list of taskNames to remove using the exact same syntax used in 
the monospace.yml file. If no task is provided you will be prompted to select a
task to remove from the pipeline.

It will also remove the task from other tasks dependencies. And perform a check
on cyclic dependencies before saving the changes.

```
monospace tasks remove [taskName]... [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                         help for remove
  -p, --project-filter strings       Filter projects by name
                                     This is like 'whitelisting' project in the list
                                     You can use 'root' for monospace root directory
  -P, --project-filter-out strings   Filter out by name
                                     Exclude projects from the list (blacklisting)
```
