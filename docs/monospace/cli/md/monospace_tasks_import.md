## monospace tasks import

Import scripts entries from projects package.json.

### Synopsis

Import scripts entries from projects package.json file as monospace pipeline task.

You can either pass a list of scripts to import using the syntax
'projectName#scriptName', or you can let the command prompt you for scripts to
import. You can narrow choices presented to you by using the --project-filter
flag. 

If running in interactive mode you will be able to edit the task before adding it
to the pipeline.

Pipeline will be checked for cyclic dependencies before saving any changes.


```
monospace tasks import [projectName#scriptName]... [flags]
```
