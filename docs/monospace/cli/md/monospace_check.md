## monospace check

Performs various checks on the monospace config file and projects

### Synopsis

Performs various checks on the monospace config file and projects.

## Check projects
Check projects remote origin match the monospace config file

While using monospace you will import some new repositories to the monospace,
create local projects which soon will become either internal or external projects.
This command help you maintain projects remote origins and projects settings
in the monospace.yml config file consistent.

Here's the reported anomalies and the action taken when --fix flag is used:
- for local projects:
	- check it's still a git repository: fixed by setting project as internal
	- check project remote origin is still not set: fixed by updating config
		with repo remote origin or setting project internal
- for external projects:
	- check project files exists: fixed by cloning the project
	- check project dir is a git repository: fixed by setting project internal
	- check project repo origin match the one in config: fixed by updating the
		config with repo remote origin
- for internal projects:
	- check project dir exists: fixed by removing project from config
	- check project is not a git repository: fixed by updating config with
		repo remote origin (error if remote origin is not set)

More choices may be available when --interactive flag is used

## Check pipeline
- Check tasks are associated with existing projects.
- Check tasks depends on existing non persistent tasks.
- Check for circular task dependencies
There's no fix available on pipeline errors
