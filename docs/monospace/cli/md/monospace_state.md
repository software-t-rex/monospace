## monospace state

Allow to pin a full monospace state and restore it later

### Synopsis

The state command allow to "pin" the state of all projects in the monospace and
to "restore" pinned states at a later time. This can be useful when you want to 
reproduce a particular state of your monospace and share it with co-workers.

Basically this store the current revision of all projects in the monospace.
This is not a full backup of the monospace as it does not store the content of 
the projects but only the revision of each project.

When using the "state restore" command, each projects will be checked out to the
given revision. This will leave your repositories in a detached head state.

Local projects will be ignored and left as is.

This is highly experimental, any feedback will be greatly appreciated!
