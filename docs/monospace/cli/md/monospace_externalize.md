## monospace externalize

Turn an 'internal' project into an 'external' project

### Synopsis

Turn an 'internal' project into an 'external' project.

Here what this command will really do:
- Check that the project path is clean
	- Propose to stash uncommited changes (--no-interactive will say yes)
- Use git subtree split to extract the project directory and related history
- Remove extracted directory from the monospace
- Init a new repository in the project directory
	- optionally set initial branch name (--initial-branch=name, default to 'master')
	- optionally set the new repo origin if repoUrl was given
- merge the extracted branch from root repository into the newly created repo
	- optionally push -u to the new repo origin (--push)
- Add the projectName to the monospace .gitignore
- Mark the project as external (if repoUrl is set) or local in monospace.yml
- remove the temporary subtree branch from root repository if there's no error

You can then review changes in the monospace root repository and commit them.

> Beware that the operation will remove all files in the project directory
> before re-creating them. You should check that there's no untracked files
> before proceeding as they will be lost.
