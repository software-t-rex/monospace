.SH NAME
.PP
monospace-externalize - Turn an 'internal' project into an 'external' project


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBmonospace externalize projectName [repoUrl] [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Turn an 'internal' project into an 'external' project.

.PP
Here what this command will really do:
- Check that the project path is clean
	- Propose to stash uncommited changes (--no-interactive will say yes)
- Use git subtree split to extract the project directory and related history
- Remove extracted directory from the monospace
- Init a new repository in the project directory
	- optionally set initial branch name (--initial-branch=name, default to 'master')
	- optionally set the new repo origin if repoUrl was given
- merge the extracted branch from root repository into the newly created repo
	- optionally push -u to the new repo origin (--push)
- Add the projectName to the monospace .gitignore
- Mark the project as external (if repoUrl is set) or local in monospace.yml
- remove the temporary subtree branch from root repository if there's no error

.PP
You can then review changes in the monospace root repository and commit them.

.PP
Beware that the operation will remove all files in the project directory
before re-creating them. You should check that there's no untracked files
before proceeding as they will be lost.
